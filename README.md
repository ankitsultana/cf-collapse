# CF-Comments

This is a chrome-extension to inject some CSS + JS into Codeforces'
blog pages to make the comments section a little neater â€” whilst
adding minimal overhead.

It's basically 60 odd lines of CSS and 5 lines of JS to toggle CSS class
of the comments.

Features:

* Neater UI (arguably)
* Collapsible comment threads (Click on the **age** of the comment to toggle)

### Installation

**Via Webstore** : [Link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cf-collapse/cgaimlfijkkfgalpjbkaembhgmehfoai)

**Loading Unpacked** : Just load the `chrome` directory in this repo
on the extensions page on Chrome (which is accessible via `chrome://extension`),
using `Load Unpacked`. Here is a
