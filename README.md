# CF-Comments

This is a chrome-extension to inject some CSS + JS into Codeforces'
blog pages to make the comments section a little neater â€” whilst
adding minimal overhead.

It's basically 60 odd lines of CSS and 5 lines of JS to toggle CSS class
of the comments.

Features:

* Neater UI (arguably)
* Collapsible comment threads (Click on the time stamp of the comment to toggle)

### Installation

**Via Webstore** : Coming Soon

**Loading Unpacked** : Just load this repo in `chrome://extension`, using
`Load Unpacked`. Here is a

that explains how to load an unpacked chrome extension.
